    "I plan to train, validate, and test three models with three different ML algorithms to follow agile model development, which starts with a simple modeling approach and improves by cycling through more complex modeling designs. I will use Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. I will use Logistic Regression because the algorithm yields simpler, interpretable results, and it provides probabilities for each class. I will use Decision Trees because they allow us to observe how decisions are made based on different features. To generalize even further from these two models, I will use Random Forest, which is a bootstrap aggregating algorithm that involves an ensemble of deep decision trees to improve accuracy and achieve the optimal balance of low bias and low variance.\n",

    "    \n",
    "First, I will use `train_test_split` method from the `sklearn.model_selection` module to split the data. Next, I will create initial models for the three ML algorithms using default parameters to find a baseline comparison, and fit them on the training data sets. Then, I will use the `predict()` method to use the fitted model to predict the class labels for the test set and the `predict_proba()` method to use the fitted model to predict class probabilities for the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze performance of individual models, I will use various metrics and methods to display them:\n",
    "- Accuracy Score\n",
    "- ROC-AUC Score\n",
    "- `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics` to display the main classification metrics of Accuracy, Precision, Recall.\n",
    "- Confusion Matrix to display True/False Positives & Negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare performance between models, I will compare these metrics. I will also compute the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve for each model and plot the curves on one lineplot, as well as compute the Area Under the [ROC] Curve (AUC) score and compare this metric among the three models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I will conduct validation of my data. I choose not to use stepwise feature selection or regularization for for feature selection because I already intend to perform heuristic feature selection prior to model training. I will perform hyperparameter optimization through `GridSearchCV()` using k-fold cross-validation where `k=5` to emphasize out-of-sample validation. K-fold cross-validation involves performing the holdout method (train and validation) k times, such that each time, it trains on k - 1 training folds and test on one validation fold. In this way, every fold will have a chance to serve as a validation set. It then then averages the resulting prediction accuracies obtained on each of the k iterations to get a good estimate of our model’s performance on new data.\n",

    "When choosing from accuracy, precision, or recall as a classification metric, precision seems to be the most appropriate with respect to the context of my business problem. Precision is considered when the cost of predicting a false positive is high, and I believe this to be the case when a financial institution wants to predict the income class of an individual for their creditworthiness. If the model predicts an individual to make over \\\\$50,000 a year when they actually make less or equal to \\\\$50,000, the financial institution may make misinformed decisions on the individual's creditworthiness, which will end up being more costly. However, I will still compare other metrics such as accuracy and ROC-AUC score to form a more nuanced explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LR model yields the greatest precision at 0.78, with the RF model falling short at a precision of 0.77, and the DT model having the least precision at about 0.76. This means that the LR model has the highest ratio of true predictions of an individual's income being greater than \\\\$50,000, to the total amount of individuals predicted to have an income of over \\$50,000. The LR model has an accuracy of about 0.814, the DT model has an accuracy of about 0.816, and the RF model has an accuracy of about 0.82. This means that the models are very close to each other in having the highest ratio of correct predictions to the total amount of predictions. Furthermore, the LR and RF models have equal ROC-AUC scores at about 0.83, with the DT model having an ROC-AUC score of about 0.79. This means that the LR and RF models have a 83% chance of correctly ranking a randomly chosen individual making greater than \\\\$50,000 higher than a randomly chosen individual making less or equal to \\\\$50,000. When taking these metrics into account, the LR and RF models are close in performance with the DT model falling short. \n",

    "The DT and RF models yield the greatest precision at 0.82, with the LR model falling short at a precision of 0.78. All models have yielded an improved precision. This means that the DT and RF models approximately tie in having the greatest ratio of true predictions of an individual's income being greater than \\\\$50,000, to the total amount of individuals predicted to have an income of over \\\\$50,000. The LR model has an accuracy of about 0.81, the DT model has an accuracy of about 0.83, and the RF model has an accuracy of about 0.82. This means that the DT model has the highest ratio of correct predictions to all predictions. Furthermore, the LR model has an ROC-AUC score at about 0.830, the LR model has an ROC-AUC score at about 0.859, and the RF model has an ROC-AUC score at about 0.868. The ROC-AUC scores of the DT and RF models have improved after optimization. Taking all of the classification metrics into account, prioritizing precision, we find that the models are very close in performance with the Random Forest model slightly outperforming the others. \n",

    "For the future, I can further explore feature selection, narrowing down the feature subset even more to determine the ideal subset of features when training and testing a machine learning model. I only performed heuristic feature selection, but stepwise feature selection and regularization for feature selection can be viable to conduct during model validation alongside hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, I can explore different models for supervised learning that I did not use here, such as comparing my Random Forest algorithm with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) to determine the best ensemble method, or even implementing a classification neural network.\n",
