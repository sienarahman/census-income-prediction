# ðŸ’µ Census Income Classification Project

This project was developed from Lab 8: Define and Solve an ML Problem from the eCornell Machine Learning Foundations course. Using the [Census Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income), I followed the ML Life Cycle. I developed business understanding and formulated a problem, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeled and evaluated the model while performing out-of-sample validation.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem
Objective: Predict whether annual income of an individual exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
ML Problem Type: Binary Classification
Label/Target Variable: `income_binary`
